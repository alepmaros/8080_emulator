# 8080 CPU emulator

The classic Intel's 8080 CPU emulator to run Space Invaders

The initial code will probably be heavily influenced by kpmiller's Emulator101
tutorial but since that tutorial is written to be friendly rather than 
optimized/organized I may make some changes along the way.

I don't have a clear goal on what I intend to do with this, just learn about
emulators and CPUs.
